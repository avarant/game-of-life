Conway's Game of Life made using tkinter

The Rules
For a space that is 'populated':
    Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
    Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
    Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
    Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
