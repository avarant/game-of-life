# Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life animated using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)

Rules from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

> These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:
> 1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
> 2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
> 3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
> 
> The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system.
